# Eva's Code for Project 1: 1D Interface

This is a modified version of Marcelo's original 2 player game. The new game is single-player using the WASD keys to go left, right, "up", and "down", respectively. The W and S keys control y-position, which I've chosen to display as brightness since we only have a 1D interpretation of a 2D board. W makes the y value higher, and thus decreases brightness-- S does the opposite. The game ends when you've successfully caught the target 5 times. The R key resets the game.
